This is an example of using Leaflet.js and Oracle's ADF Model View Control framework.
The weather patterns are derived from the GeoNames Web services API

The simple map - allows the enduser to type in cities around the world, and get an up to date weather status for their 
chosen location. A working example can be reviewied here : http://mrisney.com/adfleaflet/faces/index.jspx
